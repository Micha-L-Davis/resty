# ***RESTY***

---------------------------------

## Web Application

***[Explain your app, should be at least a paragraph. What does it do? Why should I use? Sell your product!]***

A web-based REST API testing client built with React and Sass.

The app provides an interface through which an API endpoint can be entered and a REST method request constructed. The app will send the request and print the results to an output area.  The app also tracks the history of user requests, and allows the user to navigate that history.
